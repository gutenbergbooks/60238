<p class="h2">EDITORIAL NOTES.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">At least three</span> decisions of nation-wide import were made by the United
States Supreme Court in December. The first, American Steel Foundries
v. Tri-City Trades&#146; Council we give, probably in full, elsewhere, as taken
from the &#147;New York Times.&#148; It is on the subject of strikes and picketing,
and speaks for itself. Another tested the law of Arizona, which
made picketing, etc., that tended to destroy an employer&#146;s business, lawful,
and the law was held to be unconstitutional, although by a divided Court,
5 to 4. Among the dissenters was Mr. Justice Pitney. The main opinion
was lengthy and explicit, and we think, fair and just. The third was
on the subject of the &#147;open competition&#148; plan by which members of the
National Hardwood Manufacturers&#146; Associations believed they were getting
around the Sherman Act, but are now told by the Court their practices
are in restraint of trade. The Association was prosecuted by the
Government in the Federal Court at Memphis, and a permanent injunction
was obtained against continuance of the practices of filing by hardwood
concerns of reports of business operations with a central organization,
such reports being open to all other members of the organization.
The opinion holding the conduct of the members of the Association to be
illegal was delivered by Justice Clark. As usual, of late, there were dissents,
this time by Justices Holmes, Brandies and McKenna. The meetings
of the members resulted in concerted action, Justice Clarke stated,
to raise prices regardless of conditions, and the plan was termed by him
&#147;misleading and a misnomer&#148; and &#147;an old evil in a new dress and a new
name.&#148; He added that instead of a plan to promote open competition it
operated to restrict competition. It was futile, he said, to argue that the
plan was merely to furnish information which could not be otherwise
obtained. The secretary of the Association, through an expert statistician,
utilized replies to questionnaires and other information furnished by the
members of the Association as the basis for bulletins and advices. These
replies also were utilized in predicting and promoting advances in prices,
by withholding of products from the market, awaiting higher prices.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">In the second case referred to in the preceding paragraph the United
States Supreme Court thus laid down the rule as to the &#147;secondary boycott&#148;:
It is to be observed that this [the case in hand] is not the mere case
of a peaceful secondary boycott, as to the illegality of which courts have differed
and States have adopted different statutory provisions. A secondary
boycott of this kind is where many combine to injure one in his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
business by coercing persons against their will to cease patronizing him
by threats of similar injury. In such a case the many have a legal right
to withdraw their trade from the one, they have the legal right to withdraw
their trade from third persons and they have the right to advise
third persons of their intention to do so when each act is considered
singly. The question in such cases is whether the moral coercion exercised
over a stranger to the original controversy by steps in themselves
legal becomes a legal wrong. But here the illegality of the means used
is without doubt and fundamental. The means used are the libelous and
abusive attacks on the plaintiffs&#146; reputation, like attacks on their employers
and customers. Threats of such attacks on would-be customers, picketing
and patrolling of the entrance to their place of business and the consequent
obstruction of free access thereto&mdash;all had the purpose of depriving
the plaintiffs of their business. To give operation to a statute whereby
serious losses inflicted by such unlawful means are in effect made remedyless,
is, we think, to disregard fundamental rights of liberty and property
and to deprive the person suffering the loss of due process of law.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">It is with deepest regret that an announcement in our obituary columns
in this issue includes the name of ex-Justice Bennet Van Syckel as a
deceased member of the Bar and jurist. Those who practiced under him
in the Circuits in former years, or who knew him as the bright, fully-equipped
ornament of the Supreme Bench, well understand that his passing
cuts off the last link between the Supreme Court of a few decades ago
and the Court as constituted to-day. Justice Van Syckel was approaching
92 years of age, and many were the hopes that he would retain his health
and vigor of intellect until he reached an even hundred years. The Courts
wherein he sat, and the present older members of the Bar will see to it
that his merits are officially pronounced; we can only say now that no
eulogy to be given to his memory will do him over-justice. His dignity,
fairness and sound legal judgment on the Bench were such that he
deserved even greater honors than he received and his private life was
immaculate. An excellent portrait of the Justice as he appeared in 1905
will be found in the Law Journal of that year (Vol. 28, facing p. 6).</p>

<p class="indent">The following seems almost an impossible propaganda to come even
from Germany at this time, but especially from one of the sources named.
The &#147;Pathfinders League,&#148; of Stuttgart, we assume to be a Social (practically
Soviet) organization, but the &#147;Christian Young People&#146;s Societies,&#148;
must be at least a quasi-religious body. A circular sent out and published
by these organizations on July 22 last says:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;War is the most exalted and holiest expression of human activity.
Some day the hour of battle will strike for us, too, when we, as officers,
go forth against the enemy. The people, which is a minor politically,
will then fall into line of itself. In the days of secret, happy expectation
there then goes from heart to heart the cry: &#145;With God for King and
Fatherland!&#146; Still and deep in German hearts there must live the joy
of battle and a longing for it. So, let&#146;s laugh to scorn those old women
in men&#146;s breeches who fear war and wail that it is horrible and criminal.
No and again, No! War is beautiful, and it is glorious to die for the
Fatherland and the hereditary ruling house. Our great ally above will
lead us splendidly.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
In New York City there is a municipal ordinance requiring landlords,
who are to give tenants under a lease hot water, to furnish it or be
arrested, fined and, if thought wise by the magistrate, imprisoned. Recently
a landlord in the Bronx was found guilty of failure to supply hot
water, and it appeared that the landlord and tenant had somehow
become on unfriendly terms; that there was a special valve in the house
which permitted hot water to go to one apartment and to be shut off
from another; and that the landlord closed down the valve to shut off the
hot water of the complaining tenant. Thirty days in prison and a fine
of $250 was the penalty imposed by the Justices in Special Sessions.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Among the important decisions in the Court of Errors and Appeals
in this State on Nov. 14th last was one unanimously confirming the conviction
of the negro, George Washington Knight, for the murder of
Mrs. Edith Marshall Wilson, the church organist at Perth Amboy, in
March last, which murder the prisoner had confessed. (See N. J. L. J.,
April, 1921, p. 102). Although the Court was unanimous in upholding
the conviction of Knight, three of the Judges, Chancellor Walker, Justice
Kalisch and Judge Black, differed with the view of the majority as to the
constitutionality of the Mackay Act of 1921 (Laws, Ch. 349), empowering
the Court of Errors and Appeals to review the sufficiency of the evidence
in criminal cases, where the defendant elects to take up the entire
record. Mr. Justice Kalisch wrote a minority opinion, concurring in
the affirming of the conviction but differing with the majority as to the
constitutional question involved. Chief Justice Gummere, in the main
opinion, said that the statute of 1921 was not novel, but is similar to an
Act passed more than twenty years ago, but subsequently repealed, under
which the Court of Errors set aside a conviction for murder in the first
degree. The first ground of attack was that the Mackay Act violates the
provisions of the Constitution relative to trial by jury, which provides that
the guilt or innocence of a defendant shall be determined by an impartial
jury. The Court said, however, that the question of the verdict being
in accordance with the weight of the evidence cannot be raised by the
State, but only by the defendant. Therefore, the Court held, the constitutional
protection afforded by a jury trial is not lessened by the law
under which the accused may elect to have the evidence reviewed. The
Court also held that the right given the Court of Errors to order a
new trial where the evidence seemed insufficient was not a novel proposition,
but was rather extending to the reviewing tribunal a power now
existing in the trial Court; that such an extension of power, provided
it does not trespass upon the inherent powers of any other Court, is not
unconstitutional. Having decided the legal questions involved, the Court
reviewed the testimony upon which Knight was convicted and concluded
it was sufficient to justify the jury&#146;s verdict of murder in the first degree.
Later, Mr. Justice Bergen, before whom the Knight trial was held,
resentenced the prisoner to be electrocuted.</p>

<p class="indent">At the Convention of the Real Estate League of New Jersey in
Newark recently, Mr. Frank B. Jess, of Haddon Heights, whose experience
on the State Board of Taxes and Assessment has made him an
authority on the subject of taxation, its inequalities and shortcomings,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg&nbsp;4]</span>
stated with positiveness that the personal property tax is a failure and
always will be a failure. &#147;It is obvious,&#148; he added, &#147;that if all the taxable
property in the State should be assessed at its true value, or at a uniform
percentage of true value, the burden of taxation would be apportioned
with exact equality. The chief objective of the assessing system of the
State, therefore, is uniformity of valuation. It would be foolish to suppose
that this ideal can ever be wholly attained. But it is more foolish
not to aim at its attainment. The scheme of assessment should be devised
with that end in view and so framed as to facilitate its achievement.
The prevailing scheme provides as many assessors as there are taxing
units. Even if each assessor were an expert the grand result inevitably
would be a great variety of valuations. As so many assessors are not
experts the absence of uniformity is all the more conspicuous.&#148; Mr. Jess
said that each assessor or assessing body is now a separate machine,
functioning independently in a particular territory. He declared that
an assessor should be a part of a system having a central power plant
functioning for the entire State.</p>

<p class="indent">After three days of argument by lawyers in the Federal case in New
York City concerning the intent of and Court decisions on the Sherman
law against trusts, Judge Hand imposed fines of $3,000 each on the
seven corporations and ten individuals who had pleaded guilty to violating
the Sherman Act. The defendants were those of the Terra Cotta
Trust, and included companies in New Jersey, at Perth Amboy and
Rocky Hill. Nearly at the same time Judge Van Fleet, so well known
as a jurist of California, but descended from an old New York and New
Jersey family, did better as to real justice with four members of the Tile
and Mantel Trust, who also had pleaded guilty to violations of the Sherman
law, by sentencing three of them to pay a fine of $4,000 each and
to spend four months in prison, and the fourth to pay a fine of $2,000 and
to spend two months in prison. There were also fines on others. The
fines on all members of the combine aggregated nearly $170,000. It is
clear that only by heavy fines with imprisonment added can the Sherman
law against widely-extended and injurious trusts be made to act as a
deterrent of such trusts in the future.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">The Attorney-General of the United States, in an address at the last
meeting of the American Bar Association in Cincinnati, gave, as suggestions,
six rules for the handling of labor disputes. They were:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;First&mdash;It is an undisputed fact that the public have a right to know
what the quarrel is about in every actual or threatened strike or lockout
and similar controversies.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Second&mdash;There should be some definite agencies in government for ascertaining
these facts fully and making an impartial finding by those specially
qualified both by temperament and training to do this particular kind of
work; and such finding should be reported so that it will be a reliable
source of knowledge to which students and publicists and statesmen can
resort.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Third&mdash;Compulsory jurisdiction over these two factors to compel
them to submit to an inquiry of this sort is not only desirable but just.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Fourth&mdash;At present our study of this question has not been sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg&nbsp;5]</span>
thorough to warrant legislation compelling the acceptance of such
findings by the parties thereto. Therefore, the jurisdiction of the proper
agency should be obligatory upon the parties to submit to the investigation;
the acceptance of the finding by the parties should be voluntary.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Fifth&mdash;The experience of the past shows that in most cases full,
accurate, reliable publicity has been sufficient to compel an adjustment
of these cases. Public sentiment is a controlling factor and it is important,
in justice to both of the parties, that it should depend upon something
more accurate than successful propaganda.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Sixth&mdash;In the course of time knowledge of the nature and causes
of these controversies derived in this way may crystallize public sentiment
to the extent that laws can be enacted making such controversies impossible.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">It will thus be seen that Mr. Dougherty does not favor obligatory
arbitration in the case of labor disputes, his view being that public sentiment
will decide them. But we have always been clear in our own mind
that there must be compulsory acquiescence in the findings of whatever
tribunal hears such disputes; otherwise one party or the other will, too
often, not acquiesce.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">In a recent Chancery case, where an injunction had been ordered by
the Court restraining a corporation from doing anything while the matter
of a permanent receivership was under consideration, a voluntary petition
in bankruptcy was filed. In proceedings against certain officers of
the corporation for contempt in thus disobeying the injunction, Chancellor
Fielder suspended sentence upon the ground that, as a mitigating circumstance,
they had been badly advised, and said: &#147;I think that the
conduct of counsel in the case was absolutely reprehensible. Counsel
was bound to know the law, and if he did not know the law, he ought
to have had common sense enough to know that an order of this Court
restraining any act of the corporation was sufficient to forbid the filing
of a voluntary petition in bankruptcy. If the order to show cause had
been directed to counsel I think I would find him guilty of contempt of
Court, and I don&#146;t think that any mitigating circumstance could be
offered in his behalf.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Our readers are receiving this month, in addition to the usual charming
article by former Judge Frederic Adams, a Fourth of July oration delivered
by Mr. Justice Parker of our Supreme Court in the Church of St.
Mary&#146;s-by-the-Sea, Northeast Harbor, Maine, two and a-half years ago.
Because this address is not recent gives special reason for its publication
now. We only learned recently of this address and, after seeing it, requested
of the Judge the privilege of publishing it in the Law Journal, a
request finally granted. It seemed to us not only that the general matter
and fine, clear statement of facts and elevated American sentiments warranted
the preservation of this address, but also that our readers might be
interested to compare what some of our best minds thought of events at
the close of the Treaty at Versailles and what has really happened since in
American and world affairs.</p>

<p class="h2">SOME REMINISCENCES, MOSTLY LEGAL.</p>

<hr class="hrsm" />

<p class="h3">BY HON. FREDERIC ADAMS, LOS ANGELES, CAL.</p>

<hr class="hrsm" />

<p class="h3">III. <span class="smcap">Anecdotes of the Harvard Law School and of its Famous
Triumvirate</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">I have on my shelves a beautiful book. &#147;The Centennial History of
The Harvard Law School,&#148; 1817-1917, published by The Harvard Law
School Association, 1918. This work, of about four hundred pages, has
been written and compiled by the Faculty, with the assistance of graduates.
It is admirably printed on excellent paper and liberally illustrated.
The whole story of the great School is spread before the reader:
its modest beginning; its Golden Age of Story and Greenleaf; the sedate
and conservative era of the Triumvirate, Parker, Parsons and Washburn,
in which my own lot fell; and then Langdell, the apostle of a new
idea, and his many brilliant and interesting followers. The centre of
gravity has been shifted from the text-book to the case and this is philosophical,
for evidently the cases are the original evidences of the law.
But the idea of taking up what Thackeray calls &#147;the vast legend of the
law&#148; as a direct subject of study was so revolutionary that it won its
way very slowly. I quote from the &#147;Centennial History&#148; a spirited sketch
of Professor Langdell&#146;s opening, and of the early history of the new system:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The day came for the first trial of the new method of study and
teaching. The class gathered in the old amphitheater of Dane Hall&mdash;the
one lecture room of the School&mdash;and opened their strange new pamphlets,
reports bereft of their only useful part, the head-notes! The lecturer
opened his.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;&#145;Mr. Fox, will you state the facts in the case of Payne v. Cave?&#146;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Mr. Fox did his best with the facts of the case.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;&#145;Mr. Rawle, will you give the plaintiff&#146;s argument?&#146;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;Mr. Rawle gave what he could of the plaintiff&#146;s argument.</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;&#145;Mr. Adams, do you agree with that?&#146;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;And the case-system of teaching law had begun.... Consider
the man&#146;s courage.... Langdell was experimenting in darkness
absolute save for his own mental illumination. He had no prestige,
no assistants, no precedents, the slenderest of apparatus, and for the most
part an uncompromising <i>corpus vile</i>. He was the David facing a complacent
Goliath of unshaken legal tradition, reinforced by social and literary
prejudice. His attempts were met with the open hostility, if not of the
other instructors, certainly of the bulk of the students. His first lectures
were followed by impromptu indignation meetings. &#145;What do we care
whether Myers agrees with the case, or what Fessenden thinks of the
dissenting opinion? What we want to know is: &#147;What&#146;s the law?&#148;&#146;</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;A controversy at once sprang up as to the efficacy of this method of
instruction. To most of the students, as well as to Langdell&#146;s colleagues,
it was abomination. The students cut his lectures; only a few remained.
But these few were the seed of the new School. They included several
men who afterward attained national reputation: James Barr Ames, his
greatest pupil and successor; Franklin G. Fessenden, member of the
Superior Court of Massachusetts; Austen G. Fox, a leader of the New
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
York Bar; Edward Q. Keasbey, of New Jersey; James J. Myers, Speaker
of the Massachusetts House of Representatives and one of the leaders of
the Boston Bar; and Francis Rawle of Philadelphia, a President of the
American Bar Association. Working out his cases with these enthusiastic
young men, patiently and thoroughly as he always worked, Langdell did
nothing to force upon others the acceptance of his system. In a few
years Ames was appointed to the Faculty, and brought youth, fire, virility
into the contest; but for many years the two were alone in their use
of the new method. It was ten years before others acceded to it.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The fact was that something had to be done. The School was on the
down grade. I state this no more strongly than the History does at
pages 21 to 25. This was the natural result, I think, of an extremely
inefficient method of instruction. Nothing could be less effective than a
series of lectures which no one was bound to attend, without recitations
or examinations, so that it was possible for a student to receive his
degree after a year and a half of residence without learning any law.
Such a system might do for very zealous and ambitious students, but not
for a large class. That the School held up its head as long as it did was
due to two things: the <i>genius loci</i>, which counted for a good deal, and
the personal influence and example of the professors, who were superior
men.</p>

<p class="indent">I write with the reserve proper to one who is considering an educational
policy of which he has had no personal experience, but it seems to
me that, in the last analysis, Professor Langdell&#146;s new idea was this:
to rouse, develop, discipline and cultivate the judgment, and so, as far
as possible, to equip each student with that valuable attribute, easily recognized
but hard to define or describe, which is called a legal mind. It
is judgment that does it. A mechanic of good judgment is already half
a lawyer; an attorney of poor judgment will always remain in the
apprentice class.</p>

<p class="indent">I am reminded how I first saw Langdell&#146;s name. After I left the
Law School I was for a time a member of the New York Bar. As I went
upstairs to my office at No. 16 Wall street, I would see above me, at the
top of the next flight, the sign of a law firm, Pierrepont, Stanley &amp; Langdell.
I knew about Pierrepont, who was a Yale man of the class of
1837, and I somehow got the idea, perhaps unjust to Mr. Pierrepont, that
one of the junior partners was an erudite man who acted as purveyor of
legal ideas to the head of the firm, somewhat as Sydney Carton did for
Mr. Stryver in &#147;A Tale of Two Cities.&#148; The selection of Mr. Langdell
as a professor was due to the sagacity of President Eliot.</p>

<p class="indent">An interesting and valuable part of the History is a biographical
list of the ninety-one men who were teachers in the School during the
century covered by the book. One of the names is that of Justice Francis
J. Swayze, of the New Jersey Supreme Court, who began in the Centennial
year, 1917, a course of lectures on Legal Ethics, which he continues.</p>

<p class="indent">I now go back to my own time at the Law School. There was a
small Jersey group there. Nehemiah Perry, Henry Young, Job H. Lippincott,
Abram Q. Garretson and John R. Emery were men who, like
Othello, &#147;have done the State some service.&#148; When Vice-Chancellor
Emery passed away, I became the only survivor of the little company.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
Professor Joel Parker, as I knew him, was a courteous gentleman of
the old school, sixty-nine years of age, <i>tenax propositi</i> public-spirited,
courageous and combative, who had established a high reputation as a
jurist by his opinions as Chief Justice of New Hampshire for fifteen
years. As a conservative Whig he had supported the Compromises of
1850, but presided over a meeting of the citizens of Cambridge, held June
2, 1856, to denounce the assault on Senator Sumner. The conclusion of
his speech on that occasion showed the mettle of the man. &#147;For myself,
personally, I am perhaps known to most of you as a peaceful citizen, reasonably
conservative, devotedly attached to the Constitution, and much too
far advanced in life for gasconade; but, under present circumstances,
I may be pardoned for saying that some of my father&#146;s blood was shed
on Bunker Hill, at the commencement of one revolution, and that there
is a little more of the same sort left, if it shall prove necessary, for the
beginning of another.&#148; The Professor had a true instinct. The attack
on Senator Sumner was the first act of civil war; the John Brown raid
the second; the firing on Fort Sumpter the third.</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Parker, when Chief Justice of New Hampshire, had a
memorable struggle with Judge Story, who held the United States Circuit
Court, over a question under the Bankrupt Law. The facts are stated on
pages 245 and 246 of the History of the Law School. In my time it
was thought that Professor Parker did not like Story, or Story&#146;s rather
showy law books. He probably would have agreed with the following
remarks on page 12 of the History: &#147;Story was the kindly master who,
in his lectures, smoothed the rough places and was profuse with instruction
and help. We may suppose his lectures, like his books, to have been
learned, fluent, often original and profound, sometimes, however, dodging
a difficulty rather than trying to overcome it.&#148; I have heard it said that
Story stands higher as a writer of opinions than as a legal author.</p>

<p class="indent">There was in my day a student named Stevenson who was assigned
to argue one side of a Moot Court case before Professor Parker, sitting
as Judge. Stevenson, who knew and well understood the Professor, in
the course of his argument read a few sentences from one of Story&#146;s
books and then, pausing and looking at the Judge, said: &#147;May it please
your Honor. There follows this passage about half a page of Latin.
I have not read it, but it looks as though it were on our side.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Parker, during the War for the Union was <i>pro</i> the administration
<i>saepe</i>; <i>pro lege, pro republica semper</i>. He had, of course,
profound reverence for the writ of habeas corpus. A student once stated
a strong case of treasonable conduct and asked him if he would not
suspend the writ in such a case. &#147;No, sir,&#148; said the Professor, &#147;I would
not suspend the writ of habeas corpus, but I would suspend the corpus.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Theophilus Parsons was a son of the great Chief Justice
of Massachusetts of the same name. He was sixty-six years of age when
I knew him, a man of the world who had touched life at many points,
a voluminous writer of law books and an instructive and entertaining
lecturer. There was a side to his nature which he did not show to his
class. I used to have among my books a small volume of sublimated
Swedenborgian doctrine written by him. It was difficult to associate it
with the genial and jovial man you saw in the lecture room. I have
tried to assimilate this message from the New Jerusalem, but have failed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
no doubt because of some invincible ignorance and innate incapacity of my
own.</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Parsons saw something of Europe after graduating from
Harvard in 1815, and I think was at St. Petersburg with William Pinkney,
then American minister, when the Grand-duke Nicholas, who was
afterwards Emperor, was married to a Prussian princess in July, 1817.
He described Mr. Pinkney as coming in from the ceremony in a real or
affected huff, and complaining, as he tore off his gloves, that a beggarly
Grand-duke had obliged him to get up at eight o&#146;clock in the morning.
&#147;But, Mr. Pinkney,&#148; said Parsons, &#147;the wedding was not until twelve
o&#146;clock.&#148; &#147;True, sir,&#148; said Pinkney, who affected to be a man of fashion,
&#147;but can a gentleman dress in less than four hours?&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Professor Parsons wrote an interesting life of his father, who was an
old-fashioned colossus of the common law. Indeed, the Chief Justice
took pretty much all knowledge for his province, and was a classical
scholar and good mathematician. I moved, or was moved, at the early
age of three months, from my birthplace in New Hampshire to the parish
of Byfield, Massachusetts, near Newburyport, and lived there for seven
years. The father of Chief Justice Parsons was a Congregational minister
and pastor of the church in Byfield for more than forty years.
When I visit Byfield, as I love to do, I read upon a tablet on the parsonage
lawn &#147;Birthplace of Theophilus Parsons.&#148; The Chief Justice had an
extraordinary knowledge of the early history, laws, institutions, manners
and local usages of the settlers of New England. I had among my
law books one that used to remind me of him. A young lawyer once
asked him what was the best law dictionary. &#147;Kinnicum&#146;s is the best,&#148;
was the answer. A few days later, the young man said to him, &#147;I have
asked everywhere for &#145;Kinnicum&#146;s Law Dictionary&#146; and cannot find it.&#148;
The Chief Justice laughed and said: &#147;Ask for Cunningham&#146;s.&#148; The
book which I had was Cunningham&#146;s &#147;Law Dictionary,&#148; in two folio
volumes. A similar incident is told of Judge Story, who was also a
&#145;longshore man, born in Marblehead, a place which abounded in local
peculiarities, as we know from Whittier&#146;s version of &#147;Flud Oireson&#146;s
Ride.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Judge Story was opening the Circuit Court of the United States at
Salem, and the clerk, as he went over the panel, called &#147;Michael Treffery.&#148;
No answer. &#147;Michael Treffery!&#148; No answer. &#147;That is strange,&#148; said
the clerk, &#147;I saw the man here a few moments ago.&#148; &#147;Let me see the
list,&#148; said the Judge. He glanced at it and said, to the clerk, &#147;Call Michael
Trevay.&#148; The clerk: &#147;Michael Trevay.&#148; &#147;Present,&#148; said a juror. The
clerk: &#147;Why did you not answer?&#148; &#147;You never called my name.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Parsons, before he became Chief Justice, was sitting in his house
at Newburyport one Sunday morning, when a client and friend, who lived
at Salem, was announced and said: &#147;Mr. Parsons, I beg your pardon
for making a call on Sunday. I would not do it if it were my own matter,
but the case is that I am guardian for some minor children and a matter
of importance to them is coming up in the Probate Court at Salem
to-morrow morning. I have had no opportunity to get advice and so
I have taken the liberty to ask your counsel.&#148; &#147;Never practice law on
Sunday,&#148; said Parsons. &#147;Why, of course I understand that,&#148; said the
other, but I thought that perhaps, under all the circumstances, you might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
be willing to aid me.&#148; &#147;Never practice law on Sunday,&#148; said Parsons.
&#147;Good day, Mr. Parsons, I am sorry to have troubled you.&#148; &#147;Stop a
minute,&#148; said Parsons, &#147;do you want advice as to the moral aspect
of the case or as to the legal aspect of it?&#148; &#147;Why, as to the legal aspect,
of course. I am satisfied that my position is fair and right. I want to
know whether it will stand law.&#148; &#147;Well, now, I will tell you,&#148; said
Parsons, &#147;I don&#146;t know anything about your case and I don&#146;t want to
hear anything about it, but I know you, and if you think that your position
is fair and just you may go ahead on that and I will be responsible
for the law.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Someone asked him, when he was Chief Justice, if it were true that
he never lost a case while he was at the Bar. &#147;Yes,&#148; said the Chief
Justice, &#147;that is true. I never lost a case, but my clients lost a great
many.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Chief Justice Parsons, because of his preoccupation with his
thoughts, was sometimes careless about his dress. He was a clubable man,
to use Dr. Johnson&#146;s phrase, and some of his intimate friends thought
that in a genial hour a useful hint might be given him. So it was arranged
that Mr. Harrison Gray Otis should invite the group to dinner and manage
the matter. Mr. Otis was the one to do it, for he was a man of
taste, quite &#147;the glass of fashion and the mould of form,&#148; of great
personal elegance and public distinction, and a graceful entertainer.
Accordingly, the plan was carefully staged, and during the dinner the
conversation took a natural turn toward social customs, usages, modes of
dress and the like, and finally Mr. Otis, in a natural way, but with some
distinctness, said: &#147;For my own part, I always put on a clean shirt
every day.&#148; The Chief Justice, who had apparently been giving his
undivided attention to his dinner, here looked up and said: &#147;Why, Otis,
what a confoundedly dirty fellow you must be! I can wear a shirt for a
whole week.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Jeremiah Mason told of a professional conference between himself,
when quite a young man, and Mr. Parsons before he became Chief Justice.
Among the elements in the case was a conveyance of parish land
by a clergyman, and its nature and effect were under discussion. Mr.
Mason suggested that it might be held to be a covenant to stand seized.
Mr. Parsons turned to him quickly and said: &#147;Mason, I like that; that
is a good idea of yours; in the relation between a clergyman and his
parish there is some analogy to that between a man and his wife.&#148; Mr.
Mason, in telling the story, said: &#147;I didn&#146;t know, or had forgotten,
that a consideration of blood or marriage was necessary to support a
covenant to stand seized, but I said nothing, and as soon as I got home
I took down my books and began to study the subject, and found the
blood spurting out between the very lines of the page.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">It is grateful to recall the remaining member of the Triumvirate,
Professor Emery Washburn, for he was an enthusiast, an indomitable
and joyous worker at the age of sixty-three. I do not say that Parker
and Parsons were not enthusiasts in their own way. They must have
been so to accomplish what they did, but neither Parker nor Parsons
manifested and imparted the contagious enthusiasm about their daily
work which carried Washburn and the class with him along the arid path
of the law of real estate. He was always busy and always accessible and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
perhaps, on the whole, the most useful member of the Triumvirate. He
had been a leader of the very able Bar of Worcester and Governor of
the Commonwealth, and was the author of valuable law books, with
which the profession is familiar. I had a piece of good luck with him in
my first and only Moot Court case. As I stood up to open the case,
Professor Washburn, sitting as judge, said: &#147;Mr. Adams, instead of
reading the printed case, suppose you just state the facts in your own
way.&#148; It happened that I was about to ask him to let me do that and
was already prepared. So I came off with flying colors and probably got
more credit for readiness than I deserved.</p>

<p class="indent">I quote from the &#147;History&#148; at page 285:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;In describing his first official visit to the Law School, late in 1869,
President Eliot speaks of knocking at the door of Washburn&#146;s room and,
entering, received the usual salutation of the ever-genial Governor Washburn.
&#145;Oh, how are you? Take a chair,&#146; this without looking at me at
all. When he saw who it was, he held up both his hands with his favorite
gesture and said, &#145;I declare, I never before saw a President of
Harvard College in this building. Then and there I took a lesson from
one of the kindest and most sympathetic of teachers.&#146;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">There is, however, historical proof that on at least one prior occasion
a President of Harvard was in Dane Hall. John Quincy Adams
one day mounted his horse at Quincy and rode over to Cambridge to
see President Quincy, who greeted him and pretty soon suggested that
they call on Judge Story in his lecture room. The two distinguished
visitors were gladly welcomed and were installed by Judge Story, one
on each side of him, and he, at their request, proceeded with his lecture.
Both of these eminent gentlemen were Stoics. President Quincy went
through the New England winters without wearing an overcoat, and
Mr. Adams, when at Washington, used to swim in the Potomac and light
his own fire in winter and, I believe, read a chapter of the Old Testament
and a chapter of the New Testament and wrote in what Henry
Clay (who had been tripped up by Mr. Adams on some question of fact)
called &#147;that infernal diary of his in which he has put down everything
that has happened since the adoption of the Federal Constitution&#148;; and
all this before breakfast. As Judge Story proceeded with the rapid and
even flow of his lecture, he became aware of a smile upon the faces of his
class. A quick glance to either side of him explained it, and, with a
cautionary gesture and in a confidential tone, he said: &#147;Young gentlemen,
you see before you two melancholy examples of the evil effect of
early rising. Always remember that it is of a great deal more importance
to be awake after you are up, than simply to get up early.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">There is another story which does not relate to the Law School, but
which I will venture to tell, both as a picture of early Cambridge days,
and as a manifestation of Harvard scholarship under adverse circumstances.
There was then no Harvard Bridge and no horse-car line, and,
when the culture of Cambridge went to Boston to hear Emerson lecture
in the winter evening, the best available vehicle was a large, open, four-horse
sleigh, owned and driven by a liveryman named Morse. On one
such evening the lecture was over, and the return trip was on and so was
a fine, powdery snowstorm. The sleigh proceeded across the Cambridge
bridge and then through East Cambridge and so to Cambridge,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
stopping now on one side of a street to discharge passengers at a small
house, and now on the other side at a big house, and so on, and the fine
snow kept sifting down and Morse, perched high up in front, was growing
more and more ghostly, when out from the sleigh rose the voice of
James Russell Lowell, intoning a fragment from Horace, adapted so as
to embrace the charioteer of the sleigh:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#147;<i>Pallida Mors[e] pulsat pede pauperum tabernas</i></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Regumque turres</i>,&#148;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">which Conington translates:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#147;Pale Death, impartial, walks his round; he knocks at cottage-gate</span>
<span class="i0">And palace portal.&#148;</span>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">I have found both pleasure and profit in reviewing these associations,
especially the memories of our wise and friendly teachers, and of fellow-students
who were soon to be entrusted with the grave interests, the
sacred issues of life, liberty and property. As experience and observation
widen, one realizes how thin is the crust which separates civilized
society from the elemental fires below, and comes more and more to value
influences which preserve and institutions which stabilize. Such an influence,
such an institution is the Harvard Law School. Such an influence,
such an institution is the Brotherhood of the Bar, indissoluble save by
death or dishonor.</p>

<p class="indent">The exercises of to-day are a revival, temporary perhaps, but still
a revival, of the good old custom of celebrating the anniversary of the
Declaration of Independence by public meetings, with prayer and song,
the reading of the Declaration, and a patriotic address. It was a good
custom, though it tended to foster some erroneous ideas, particularly that
England as a nation was blameworthy in Revolutionary times, rather
than the political machinations of George III, the politician king. But
it was a good custom for all that, and it is regrettable that it gave place
to noise and fireworks.</p>

<p class="indent">In the more recent years the date has been significant of other great
crises in our history than that of Revolutionary times. That was, of
course, the greatest of all, and never to be forgotten, as it marks the
definite transition of thirteen colonies into thirteen States, organized for
war purposes as a nation. There had been over a year of war, beginning
with the skirmish at Lexington and the British retreat, followed quickly
by Ticonderoga, Bunker Hill, and the investment of Boston. During
the fall and winter there were the episodes of the burning of Portland;
the capture of Montreal (later relinquished); the capture of Norfolk in
December; Arnold&#146;s heartbreaking expedition to Quebec through Maine
forests in the dead of winter; the battle of Moore&#146;s Creek, N. C., early
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
in 1776, called the &#147;Southern Lexington,&#148; and, to crown all, the evacuation
of Boston. These events and their concomitants, say the historians,
made inevitable the Declaration of Independence, though the struggle
began only as one for greater colonial self-government and modification
of the taxing system. It was our first &#147;birth of Freedom,&#148; which
has been re-born more than once since.</p>

<p class="indent">I said the date marked other great crises in our history, and take
time to mention two of them, both in the memory of living men. The
first, and the greater, was in the midst of our Civil War, when the
news of the twin victories of Gettysburg and Vicksburg flashed over the
land. Dark days were still to come, and men were still discouraged;
the war was to be proclaimed a failure by a great political party, but the
power of the Rebellion was broken, and, after July 4, 1863, the setbacks
to the cause of nationality were but temporary and comparatively
insignificant. A second great crisis was safely passed.</p>

<p class="indent">The third great Independence Day, great for what it brought to
others than ourselves, was thirty-five years later, when the tremendous
news came that the Spanish squadron, practically all remaining efficient
of Spain&#146;s navy, had been destroyed off Santiago. That day marked the
downfall of Spanish power on this continent, and the liberation of
oppressed peoples in both hemispheres; the culmination of a righteous
war against a civilized and honorable foe, whose principal shortcoming
was a hopelessly antiquated point of view and inability to deal intelligently
with modern conditions.</p>

<p class="indent">These great anniversaries all marked the definite passing of crises;
the present one rather falls within a protracted period of crisis than
marks the passing of one. If we were to celebrate the anniversary of
the greatest crisis of recent times, I should name July 18th, 1918, when,
as most of those here will remember, the glad peals of the bell above us
sounded the news that the great allied offensive had opened. Of this
more in a few minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">But July 4 as a date does not even mark the signing of the peace
treaty. It is suggestive, however, of two things to be borne in mind at
this time: the genius of our country as a lover of liberty and fair play,
and the relation of that genius concretely to the problems of the recent
past, and the present, and the immediate future.</p>

<p class="indent">The announcement of such a subject gives me pause, for it is one
for mature consideration and careful discussion by the best of statesmen.
But there are some considerations, rather obvious perhaps, but still
worthy of inclusion at this time, which I should like to present.</p>

<p class="indent">I mentioned a moment ago our love of liberty and fair play. With
these goes a constitutional tendency to mind our own business, let other
people&#146;s business alone, and to avoid interference until convinced of
its necessity. Until 1914 we felt secure on our own continent, gave no
offense and sustained none. Fearing no war, we deemed preparation a
waste of money and time; we were not disposed to pay expensive insurance
premiums when our house was too far removed from others to be
in danger of conflagration; against internal incendiarism we thought
ourselves guarded. The warnings of Manila Bay in 1898 and Venezuela
a few years later made no impression. Confident of our ultimate
resources, we assumed no one would attack to court ultimate defeat; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
above all, fair-minded ourselves, we were utterly incredulous of unfair-mindedness
in others. Wise and farseeing men gave warning from time
to time, but the impressions were momentary.</p>

<p class="indent">And so, when in 1914 the assassination at Serajevo was quickly followed
by an impossible ultimatum, and this in a very few days developed
into a general European war, while our minds and souls revolted at a great
injustice, our continental habit of thought resisted the suggestion that
we should interfere to right that wrong. We did not see far enough;
there were those who did; and I heard two wise men, summer residents
here, agree in this very town in August, 1914, that this nation should
take part, and at once. But public opinion did not run in that channel;
nor was it led into it by our chosen rulers. These also were shortsighted,
however their vision may have been clarified subsequently. We were told
that a people should be neutral in thought as well as in deed; and so we
stood by and watched Belgium, a neutral country, ravaged and pillaged;
France invaded and destroyed; Serbia depopulated; Russia crushed.
A great crisis like the battle of the Marne stirred men&#146;s souls, but without
bringing home to us as a nation the ultimate danger to our liberty. The
consummate outrage of the &#147;Lusitania&#148; made an impression never effaced,
but the rising indignation of the country was met with the caution that
&#147;a man may be too proud to fight,&#148; and this crisis passed over also.</p>

<p class="indent">But the great giant was stirring in his sleep. Trumpet calls came
from men high in public esteem, among whom it is sufficient now to mention
Roosevelt and Leonard Wood. &#147;Preparedness&#148; was their reveille.
Our young men heard it, and in 1916 at Plattsburgh, and I think elsewhere,
sprang up the training camps. The colleges offered their facilities;
and although in the fall of 1916 there was still, as in 1860 and
1861, a large proportion of &#147;peace-at-any-price&#148; men, so large in 1916
as to permit the election of a President on the party slogan &#147;He kept
us out of war,&#148; the time was fast growing ripe. Infatuated Germany,
confident of victory in Europe and of later victory on this continent, or
risking all on the submarine issue, went a step too far, and the giant woke
up.</p>

<p class="indent">Woke up,&mdash;yes; but about as helpless as Gulliver on the Island of
Lilliput. The &#147;man mountain&#148; was tied fast with the cords of unpreparedness,
red tape, departmental inefficiency, official jealousy and hostile
intrigue. As in 1812, in 1847, in 1861 and in 1898, there was little or
nothing ready; all had to be created. The lowering of the thunder-cloud
had been unheeded. We had some destroyers and battleships and cruisers;
these were sent at once where most needed. But to our shame, be
it said, we had no trained men except the little regular army; no great
guns; no appreciable number of field pieces; no machine guns; no
small arms even, although our .30 cal. Springfield rifle is justly pronounced
the best small arm in the world. I have shot it and know it well.
They cost at that time about fifteen dollars apiece. A million of them
would have cost 15 million dollars, a sum which in these days makes us
laugh at its insignificance; it is one-half of one per cent. of our first
Liberty loan. We had not even the special tools to make barrels for
these small arms in quantity, and actually had to use English tools to make
English type rifles, greatly inferior to our own, to get any at all for our
men. The other day I saw it announced with pride in the newspapers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
that our rifle had won in competition over all others; but we did not have
them when wanted, and probably have not made them yet. We had no
field pieces to use abroad, and our artillery was equipped with the
French .75. A few naval guns were landed and mounted toward the termination
of hostilities. The aeroplane scandal is known of all men. And
it was a year after we declared war before we entered Europe in force,
and equipped then with English rifles and French field guns; and our
men were transported to Europe mainly on British ships.</p>

<p class="indent">But in this trying period several things stand out clear and bright,
and as inspirations for the future. Two are psychological: the spirit
of Americans of alien descent, and the participation of our great educational
institutions; one, official as well as psychological, the selective service
draft. The patriotism of the native American of the old stock goes,
of course, without saying.</p>

<p class="indent">The true ring of our heterogeneous population of foreign extraction
was to many a joyful surprise. That so many who had never seemed
to amalgamate with our customs, were largely uneducated, and did not
even speak our language, should respond so willingly and gladly to the
call to the colors, was a source of some amazement. Not being in their
confidence or intimacy, many of us little realized their loyalty: which
reminds me of an Italian bootblack who in conversation told me that
he wished to travel. I spoke of the beauties of Naples and Sorrento and
that neighborhood, and was rather abashed when he said: &#147;Yes, but I
would rather see my own country first.&#148; I hope that lesson will always
be fresh in memory.</p>

<p class="indent">The same spirit of Americanism marked all nationalities, not excepting
the German. The lists of draft registrants from, let us say, the east side
of Manhattan Borough, reminded one of the Epistle for Whitsunday:
&#147;Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia,
and in Jud&#230;a, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, Phrygia, and Pamphylia,
in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, Jews and proselytes,
Cretes and Arabians,&#148; all heard, and, with the deep realization
of newly liberated peoples, showed themselves proud to answer the call.</p>

<p class="indent">A recent war or Liberty loan poster is most suggestive. You read
on it a list of men&#146;s names, mostly unpronounceable, and suggestive, in the
language of the same Scripture just quoted, &#147;of every nation under
heaven,&#148; and this is summed up in the phrase, &#147;Americans all.&#148; Truly,
a fitting tribute to our adopted citizenry, equal in loyalty, bravery, and
self-sacrifice to the best of the old Americans. Among them, as just
noted, the German names stand out boldly. They are so numerous, in
fact, as to attract less notice in this country than they deserve; let us
hope that they will be noticed and taken to heart in the misguided country
where such names originated. I would that our American army,
made up in large part of such men, could occupy Germany for a time as it
formally occupied Cuba, for its own good, and give a much needed object
lesson in the theory and practice of free institutions.</p>

<p class="indent">These men, as I have said, were largely uneducated. I turn now
for a moment to those in our great seats of learning, and to the heads
and faculties and trustees of those institutions. Their stand was doubtless
one to be expected, but is still worthy of remark. That the best
blood in England suffered the most losses I think is conceded. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
would have been the case with us if the war had broken on us as it did
on Great Britain. As it was, our boys courted the posts of danger&mdash;aviation;
submarine chasers; balloon observation, and so on. Some
left college to enter the service; others stayed at college awhile, but in
order to train and perfect themselves in the art of war. The colleges
themselves became military schools; the dormitories barracks. For a
short time some anxious mothers held back, and it is little wonder that
they did. But it was not for long, and soon the woman who could wear
a pin, with one, two, or more stars in it on her bosom, gloried in it, while
she who wore a star of gold, in all her grief still cherished the solemn
pride, as Lincoln called it, of having laid so costly a sacrifice upon the
altar of her country. Whether the son was a student or ploughboy, a
bootblack or factory hand, or the son of a millionaire, the feeling was
the same. In fact, there was a tendency at first among the people at
large to suspect the well-to-do and moneyed classes of holding back their
sons. This soon wore off; and one of the most inspiring as well as
instructive sights I ever saw was on this very island; the parade of war
mothers on the Bar Harbor fair grounds; women in all walks of life,
some with gold stars on their badges.</p>

<p class="indent">College presidents who encouraged the entry of students into military
service came in for adverse criticism, but that soon passed, and now
that college, the largest percentage of whose students and graduates went
into the service, points with the greatest pride to its record in that respect.</p>

<p class="indent">I think, however, that the greatest achievement of the war, and the
one that makes most for the future safety of our country, is the success
of the selective service draft. All the books ever written, all the lectures
ever delivered, attacking the pacifistic tendencies of our people, fail
to accomplish anything of consequence in comparison with that achievement.
Whether our people have undergone a great psychologic change I
know not. It is certain that at no time previously had they submitted
willingly to be drawn into service. For a century and a quarter militia
and volunteers were the basis of the armed power on land. During the
Civil War drafting meant riots. During all our prior history bounties
for enlistment were an accepted fact.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of us may have looked into General Upton&#146;s great book called
the &#147;Military Policy of the United States.&#148; Until recently it was withheld,
for some reason, from general publication. It is the basis of a later
work by another author, &#147;The Military Unpreparedness of the United
States,&#148; which appeared about 1916. Both exhibit in startling fashion
the fundamental evils of volunteering and bounties. But not until the
stress of this great war did the old theories give way. We had a real
man as Provost Marshal General, and his name is Enoch H. Crowder,
and my own University (Princeton) and others as well, honored themselves
recently by conferring the LL.D. degree on him. I care not
whether he evolved the draft machinery himself or whether it was suggested
by others. Probably it was a result of both processes; at least he
knew a good thing when he saw it, and, like other large men, was unconcerned
about whose idea it was. Here was the problem: several million
men of age 21 to 31 to be listed, with particulars about them; those available
for military service to be selected; from these, a certain number
to be drawn by lot. The system used in the Civil War was hopelessly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span>
inadequate; army officers could not be spared to supervise the lists;
how were the names to be obtained? How recorded? How drawn?</p>

<p class="indent">The origin of the fundamental plan was told me by General Crowder
himself on the day when he received his Princeton degree. He said that
he was in his office racking his brain for a method of registry that would
not take a year to operate, when a Congressman came in, and to him he
told his difficulties. The interview terminated much like that of Alice in
Wonderland and the Caterpillar, who told her how to change her height
as it crawled off through the herbage. As the anonymous Congressman
was going out through the door, he said over his shoulder: &#147;If they can
elect a President in one day, they can register in one day.&#148; Let us thank
God that the General had good ears, and excellent communication between
them and an active brain. &#147;Elect in one day&#148;&mdash;48 States; each with so
many counties; each county having so many municipalities; each municipality
so many election districts; civil, not military, officers for all of
them; officers known to and knowing the people; Governors; mayors,
election boards. <i>Why not</i>? Here is the machinery ready made, and at
hand! All that is needed is to get it going. Forty-eight Governors
responded enthusiastically; all forty-eight kept the great secret ready to
pass it on to local officials; the result we all know.</p>

<p class="indent">Two other things were needed; the willingness of those that were
of draft age to come and say so; and the confidence of the public in a
fair drawing. The latter was secured by the use of master numbers
applicable to every district; the former came naturally as a result of the
system itself. Every man of draft age became qualifiedly a volunteer,
and marched to the polling place, saying: &#147;Here I am when wanted.&#148;
To this the abolition of bounties and substitutes, the curses of the old
system, largely contributed.</p>

<p class="indent">These are three of the great things for which we should give thanks
on this Fourth of July: the solidarity of Americanism; the leadership
of our Universities, and a practical and popularly acceptable method,
now a precedent for all time, of calling up the man power of the nation.
A fourth is the resultant of them all: a great army of young men (as
has been said many times), future leaders in political life, keenly alive
to the real freedom of our American system and determined to uphold
it and to stand no nonsense about it. But for the consciousness of our
possessing this element, and but for our faith in it, we might well look
with most anxious foreboding at many troublesome and dangerous questions
now uppermost in our national life.</p>

<p class="indent">For in the midst of triumph sounds the note of anxiety&mdash;many discordant
notes in fact. Will the treaty finally be ratified? Will peace
last? Will the Germans respect their promises and fulfill them? Or
will they, already talking again of a scrap of paper, straightway begin to
prepare for a fresh coup twenty-five years or so hence? Must the peace-loving
peoples of the world still apply themselves to that most distasteful
of all tasks, the invention and manufacture and practice of means of
destroying life and property in war? And what about internal affairs?
Are individual enterprise and talent to be smothered by rule? Is the
Constitution of the United States a worn-out old one-horse shay, ready
to drop to pieces all at once? Is the Senate a back number? Is the
peaceful rule by majority to be exchanged for Bolshevik dictatorship?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
Is our transportation industry to be ruined by taxes and rate control at
one end and cost of labor at the other? Should we take an active part
in the affairs of the Eastern hemisphere, and invite European and Asiatic
powers to help regulate our continent; in short should the national policy
called the Monroe Doctrine be abolished?</p>

<p class="indent">These and many similar questions are pressing for solution. They
are not mere fancies; they are not partisan issues, though many stentorian
shouters proclaim them such; they are live and vital questions which
must be solved and will be solved, doubtless at great cost in treasure and
perhaps at some cost in blood. That they will be rightly solved in the end
I have no doubt. Nothing is settled, said someone, I forget who, until
it is settled right. It is for you and me and all of us to bear in mind that
our work is only half done: that our sacrifices and labors and efforts
during this great war that is just closed, I hope forever, are but the
beginning, and that we owe it to our country and our children to do what
we can to encourage sanity, deliberation and temperance of thought,
speech and action in all classes of the people.</p>

<p class="indent">Mild as that sounds, it is a stupendous task to perform. There rarely
was a time when unthinking people were not more inclined to listen to a
demagogue rather than a statesman; and few people think at all; still
fewer think straight. It is a rebellious people, saying &#147;Prophesy not
unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits.&#148;
It is a time of epithets rather than of logic, of lying epigrams rather than
solid truths. All the wealthy, it seems, are corrupt; all money in large
amounts is tainted; even the scales of justice are accused of falsity.
Ebullitions of this kind often indicate an undercurrent little suspected.</p>

<p class="indent">I realize that I am saying little or nothing that is new, and I have no
new methods or theories to offer for meeting the situation. One thing is
certain; before we can teach other people to think clearly, we must be
able to think clearly ourselves; to formulate and make others realize the
real issues; to perceive the fallacy or confusion in the opposing line
of thought, and point it out without offense. It is a maxim among lawyers
that a case well stated is half argued, and nothing can be more
to the point at this time. We still have real statesmen; let us listen to
them with attention and take care not to hurry too much in deciding.
Impulse leads to irretrievable error much oftener than does deliberation.
Sober second thought is usually the better.</p>

<p class="indent">But, notwithstanding this anxiety, let us rejoice in the great victory
of Liberty over autocracy and militarism. As we look back over the
last five years we see many a vision; some dreadful nightmares, others
with the seeming of the good God taking direct part in the affairs of men.
The rape of Belgium, the miracle of the Marne, the tedious deadlock
in the trenches, the ghastly failure at Gallipoli, the collapse of Rumania,
the tragedy of Russia, the debacle in Italy, the heroism of Ypres and
Passchendaele and Verdun; then the ever present dark shadow of the
submarine; the agonized cry of exhausted England and France for men,
men, men, as one offensive broke towards Calais, another towards Amiens,
another straight for Paris by way of Chateau Thierry, while our brave
boys seemed to be training interminably; the halting of the Hun at
Belleau Wood and Chateau Thierry; the crouch of the American wildcats
for their spring; until, as men&#146;s hearts seemed to fail them, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
cry went up, &#147;How long, O Lord, how long?&#148; the little bell of St.
Mary&#146;s-by-the-Sea rang as it had never rung before. Peal after peal:
some good news: what is it? &#147;The Allies have attacked; the front
between Soissons and Chateau Thierry is all crumpled up: the Germans
cannot hold the salient.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Smash after smash: it is our turn now; in Flanders, in Picardy, in
Champagne, in Lorraine: by Britain, by France, by America, singly,
doubly, and all together; each day a new victory headlined; the military
lines approaching the French boundary; the thumbtacks moved each day
on the war maps; St. Mihiel salient wiped out; Rheims freed of bombardment;
Argonne Wood, our present day battle of the wilderness,
takes time and its awful toll of human lives, but yields, for the first
time in history, to an attack by American troops; Grand Pr&#233; and open
country beyond. Forward again, until a great railroad line is cut, and
Sedan, the catastrophe of 1870, becomes the final triumph of 1918. How
we watched the telegraphic bulletins! How we studied the maps! Until,
after one false report of an armistice, the real armistice came, and our
peace-loving people, joint victors in the greatest war of all time, turned
into a horde of lunatics.</p>

<p class="indent">What a day it was, that eleventh of November! I was in Boston to
attend the wedding of a nephew, a Colonel of Artillery, who had commanded
his regiment at Cantigny and had later been ordered to this country
in connection with organization and training of troops. The guests
had to walk, as no vehicle could thread the crowd. Late editions of the
papers contained the armistice terms in full, and, as our somewhat numerous
family was gathered for five o&#146;clock tea, one member was deputed
to read the terms aloud, and there were attentive listeners. After he
had finished, no one spoke for a moment; and then a voice said, &#147;That
seems to cover the ground.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Truly we have much to thank God for, this Fourth of July. We
have left undone some things that we ought to have done, and we have
done some things that we ought not to have done; but I cannot say now
that there is no health in us. Once again we have had a new birth of
freedom; once again we highly resolve that our dead shall not have
died in vain; once again we resolve, and I think that we have shown by
deeds our determination, that &#147;government of the people, by the people,
and for the people shall not perish from the earth.&#148;</p>

<p class="h3">AMERICAN STEEL FOUNDRIES v. TRI-CITY TRADES COUNCIL.</p>

<hr class="hrsm" />

<p class="center">(U. S. Supreme Court, Dec. 5, 1921).</p>

<p class="center"><i>Strikes&mdash;Picketing&mdash;The Clayton Act&mdash;Circumstances to Be Considered in Injunction
Case</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">[<span class="smcap">Note</span>&mdash;The following case on picketing is so important, being the latest and a
final decision of the highest Court in the United States on a matter which has been
treated differently by various Courts, that we reproduce the opinion here, as published
in the &#147;New York Times.&#148;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor</span>].</p>

<p class="indent">TAFT, Ch. Justice: This is a picketing case. Only two men in the
employ of the Foundries had responded to the calling of the strike by the
Tri-City Council. They were picketers, were defendants, and were enjoined.
Only one of them was a member of a union of that council.
The case involves, as to them, the application of Section 20 of the Clayton
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
Act, of which the provisions material here are those which forbid an
injunction in behalf of an employer against, first, persuading others by
peaceful means to cease employment and labor; second, attending at any
place where such person or persons may lawfully be for the purpose of
peacefully obtaining or communicating information; third, peaceably
assembling in a lawful manner and for lawful purposes.</p>

<p class="indent">The Act emphasizes the words &#147;peaceable&#148; and &#147;lawful&#148; throughout
the phrases which were used. We do not think that these declarations
introduced any new principle into the equity jurisprudence of the Federal
Courts. They are merely declaratory of what was the best practice
always.</p>

<p class="indent">Congress thought it wise to stabilize this rule of action and to render
it uniform. Its object was to reconcile the rights of the employer in his
business and in the access of his employ&#233;s to his place of business without
intimidation or obstruction, on the one hand, and the right of the
employ&#233;s, recent or expectant, to use peaceable and lawful means to
induce prudent principles and would-be employ&#233;s to join their ranks, on
the other.</p>

<p class="indent">If, in their attempts at persuasion or communication, those of the
labor side adopt methods which, however, lawful in their announced purpose,
inevitably lead to intimidation and obstruction, then it is the Court&#146;s
duty&mdash;and the terms of Section 20 do not modify this&mdash;so to limit what
the propagandists do as to time, manner and place as to prevent infractions
of the law and violations of the right of the employ&#233;s and of the
employers for whom they wish to work.</p>

<p class="indent">In going to and from work, men have a right to as free passage
without obstruction as the streets afford, consistent with the right of
others to enjoy the same privilege. We are a social people and the accosting
by one of another in an inoffensive way and offer by the one to communicate
and discuss information with a view to influencing the other&#146;s
action, are not regarded as aggression, or a violation of that other&#146;s right.</p>

<p class="indent">If, however, the offer is declined, as it may rightfully be, then persistence,
importunity, and following do become unjustifiable annoyance
and obstruction which is likely soon to savor of intimidation. The nearer
this is to the place of business, the greater the interference with the business
and especially with the property right of access of the employer.
Such an attempted discussion attracts the curious, or, it may be, interested
bystanders. They increase the obstruction as well as the aspect of intimidation
which the situation quickly assumes.</p>

<p class="indent">In the present case, under the conditions which the evidence discloses,
all information tendered, all arguments advanced and all persuasion
used were intimidation&mdash;they could not be otherwise.</p>

<p class="indent">It is idle to talk of peaceful communication in such a place and under
such conditions. The numbers of the pickets in the groups constituted
intimidation. The name &#147;picket&#148; indicated a militant purpose, inconsistent
with peaceful persuasion. The employ&#233;s were made to run the
gauntlet. When one or more assaults or disturbances ensued, they characterized
the whole campaign, which became effective because of its
intimidating character, in spite of the admonitions given by the leaders
to their followers as to lawful methods to be pursued, however sincere.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
Our conclusion is that picketing thus instituted is unlawful and cannot
be peaceable, and may be properly enjoined by the specific term of
&#147;picketing&#148; because its meaning is clearly understood in the sphere of the
controversy by those who are parties to it. We are supported in that
view by many well-reasoned authorities, although there has been contrarity
of view. A restraining order against picketing by that name will
advise earnest advocates of labor&#146;s cause that the law does not look with
favor on an enforced discussion of the merits of the issue between individuals
who wish to work and groups of those who do not, under conditions
which subject the individuals who wish to work to a severe test of
their nerves and physical strength and courage.</p>

<p class="indent">But while this is so, we must have every regard for the Congressional
intention manifested in the Act to the principle of existing law which
declares that ex-employ&#233;s and others properly acting with them shall
have an opportunity, so far as is consistent with peace and law, to observe
who are still working for the employer, to communicate with them and
to persuade them to join the ranks of his opponents in a lawful, economic
struggle.</p>

<p class="indent">Regarding as primary the rights of the employ&#233;s to work for whom
they will, and to go freely to and from their place of labor, and keeping
in mind the right of the employer incident to his property and business to
free access of such employ&#233;s, what can be done to reconcile the conflicting
interests?</p>

<p class="indent">Each case must turn on its own circumstances. It is a case for the
flexible, remedial power of a Court of equity which may try one mode of
restraint, and if it fails or proves to be too drastic, may change it.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Action of Trespass&mdash;Lease and Sale of Property&mdash;Limitation of Term&mdash;Jurisdiction
of District Court</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Case of Joseph F. McCann, trading as The McGann Company,
against La Brecque Company. Action at law. Trespass.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Milton M. Ungur for Plaintiff.</p>

<p class="indent">Messrs. Burnett, Sorg, Murray &amp; Duncan for Defendant.</p>

<p class="center">(<span class="smcap">Conclusions</span>).</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dungan, J</span>.: This is an action of trespass brought by the plaintiff
against the defendant for the wrongful removal of plaintiff&#146;s goods from
the defendant&#146;s premises under the following conditions:</p>

<p class="indent">P. Ballentine &amp; Sons, a corporation, demised the premises in question
to defendant by lease dated August 1st, 1917, for a term commencing
November 1st, 1916, and terminating April 30th, 1926. The lease provided:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;It is further understood and agreed between the parties hereto that a
sale of the property by the party of the first part shall terminate this
lease upon six months&#146; written notice to the party of the second part; and,
in lieu of compensation, it is hereby agreed that the rent shall be waived
during the six months notice to vacate.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">By deed dated October 15, 1918, proved October 30, 1918, and
recorded October 31, 1918, P. Ballentine &amp; Sons conveyed the premises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
in question by warranty deed to the plaintiff, subject to the above tenancy.
By endorsement dated April 30, 1918, made upon the lease, P. Ballentine
&amp; Sons assigned said lease and all of the rights of the lessor thereunder,
to the plaintiff.</p>

<p class="indent">October 30, 1918, there was served personally upon defendant a
notice, dated on that day, signed by both the grantor and the grantee in
the deed last mentioned, as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;You will please take notice that the premises leased by you from
P. Ballentine &amp; Sons by written lease dated the first day of August, 1917,
have this day been sold to LaBrecque Company, Inc., and notice of the
cancellation of your said lease is hereby given you pursuant to that clause
of your lease reading as follows: &#145;It is further understood and agreed
between the parties hereto that a sale of the property by the party of the
first part shall terminate this lease upon six months&#146; written notice to the
party of the second part, and in lieu of compensation it is hereby agreed
that the rent shall be waived during the six months&#146; notice to vacate.&#146;&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The defendant did not remove from said premises at the expiration
of six months and the statutory demand for delivery of possession was
personally served on defendant. After the expiration of said period, he
refused to vacate the premises, and thereupon the defendant here instituted
and prosecuted summary proceedings in the Second District Court
of the City of Newark, in which Court judgment for possession of the
premises was rendered May 23, 1919, and the removal of plaintiffs, being
the alleged act of trespass for which this suit is brought, was, by virtue
of the order of removal, made by that Court upon said judgment.</p>

<p class="indent">There is no contention that there was any irregularity in the proceedings
of that Court, if the Court has jurisdiction; but the plaintiff
here insists that the provisions of the lease above quoted constituted a
condition, or covenant, and not a limitation of the term, and that consequently
the District Court did not have jurisdiction.</p>

<p class="indent">The parties hereto have entered into a stipulation to submit this suit
to the Court for judgment upon the complaint, answer and reply, which
correctly sets forth the facts as above stated, and adds:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;If the Court is of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover,
judgment is to be rendered in favor of the plaintiff and against the defendant,
and there is to be an assessment of the damages by a jury drawn for
that purpose, reserving however all questions of law as to the measure of
damages; and, if the Court is of the opinion that the plaintiff is not
entitled to recover, judgment shall be entered in favor of the defendant
as if said cause had been tried and a verdict in favor of the defendant
had been rendered&#148;; both parties reserving the right to appeal from the
judgment to be entered.</p>

<p class="indent">It is admitted on behalf of the plaintiff that, if the said provision of
the lease constituted limitation of McGann&#146;s terms, then the District Court
had jurisdiction and the plaintiff cannot recover in this suit.</p>

<p class="indent">The jurisdiction of the District Court in such cases is confined in its
application to the instant case, to &#147;When any such person shall hold over
and continue in possession ... after the expiration of his ...
term,&#148; etc. Admittedly the decision of this case rests upon whether or
not the sale of the premises and the notice given by the lessor and
LaBrecque Company to the plaintiff ended the term of the McGann Company.
If it did&mdash;if this was a limitation of the plaintiff&#146;s term,&mdash;the jurisdiction
of the District Court was complete.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
The case of Quidort v. Bullitt, 60 N. J. L. 119, is very much in point.
In that case it appeared by the affidavit filed with the Justice that the
defendants, in May, 1885, leased to the prosecutor a seaside cottage at
Cape May for five years, which lease was extended for two successful
periods. The lease contained the following provision: &#147;Lessors are to
have the privilege of terminating the lease at any time upon giving six
months&#146; notice of their intention to do so, prior to the first day of July
or any year during the lease.&#148;. On October 19, 1895, the defendants
caused to be served on the prosecutor a written notice, which, after reciting
the terms of the lease stated:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;We have determined to avail ourselves of the privilege of terminating
the lease. We now give you notice of the exercise of our privilege and
of our intention to terminate the said lease on the first day of May, 1896,
and demand that you surrender us possession of the leased premises at
that time, in accordance with the provisions contained in the lease. This
right to terminate the lease is exercised in accordance with the lease and
the several extensions thereof. We shall expect you to deliver to us,
on the first day of May, 1896, the cottage and bath houses mentioned
in the said lease, and also the articles mentioned and set out in the inventory
annexed thereto.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">The tenant refused to deliver possession and, on the 6th day of May,
1896, instituted proceedings before the Justice, which were the subject of
review by certiorari in that case.</p>

<p class="indent">It is insisted on behalf of the plaintiff that whether or not the quoted
provision of the lease and the giving of the notice constituted a mere condition
or covenant or was a limitation, was not decided in that case; but,
while it is not expressly so stated, it seems to me a decision of that question
was absolutely essential to a decision of the case. Chief Justice Gummere,
in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court (page 120) said:</p>

<p class="indent">&#147;The question for determination is whether the Justice had jurisdiction
of the cause; if he had jurisdiction, then the writ in this case should
be dismissed, but, if he had not, then the proceedings before him should
be set aside.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Again on page 122 he said:</p>

<p class="indent">It is alleged by the prosecutor that the facts above recited did not
bring the case within the jurisdiction of the Justice for the following
reasons: 1. That the privilege of terminating the lease was not a term,
condition or limitation of the original lease, but a special privilege, reserved
to the lessors, of ending the original term.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus it is plain that the precise question in issue in this case was
before the Court, and that it was necessary for the Court, in order to
reach the decision it did, to decide that the quoted provision would constitute
a limitation upon the term fixed by the original lease.</p>

<p class="indent">The case of Miller v. Levi, 44 N. Y. 490, is also applicable to this
case. In that case Miller demised to Levi, reserving the right to sell the
demised premises and to limit Levi&#146;s term thereon to the expiration of
sixty days after notice of sale. The sale and notice specified in the lease
was made. It was insisted that the Justice had no jurisdiction of the summary
proceedings, because this can only be resorted to where the term
of the lease of the lessee &#147;has expired by lapse of time,&#148; which it was
said was not the fact in that case. The Court said:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
&#147;Immediately upon sale by Miller and notice thereof to the tenant
the limitation attached to the estate of the latter, without further act on
the part of Miller. There then arose a limitation of his term, to wit, its
expiration on the first of May following. The act itself, in the lease contemplated,
to wit, a sale without notice, created the expiration. Nothing
further was necessary.... The &#145;term&#146; of the lease must therefore
be taken to have &#145;expired&#146; on the first of May, 1864.&#148;</p>

<p class="indent">I think, therefore, that when the leased property was sold, and the
notice of sale given to McGann on October 30th, 1918, the term of
McGann under the terms of the lease expired six months thereafter;
that the sale and notice constituted a limitation of his term; that the Second
District Court of the City of Newark, before which proceedings to
remove McGann were instituted May 2nd, 1919, had jurisdiction to
hear and determine the matter before it; and that, therefore, the defendant
is not guilty of the trespass alleged against him.</p>

<p class="indent">Judgment is given, therefore, against the plaintiff and in favor of
the defendant.</p>

<p class="h3">SOME STATE NOTES.</p>

<p class="indent">On Dec. 11 Mrs. Mary J. Rellstab,
wife of United States District
Court Judge John Rellstab, died at
her home in Trenton. She had
been an invalid for many years.
Before her marriage, in 1905, she
was Miss Mary Johnston Whittaker,
daughter of the late George
R. and Mrs. Mary Whittaker. Besides
her husband, two sisters, Mrs.
J. F. Clement of Philadelphia and
Miss Emily Whittaker of Trenton,
survive. Mrs. Rellstab was for
many years active in church and
charity work.</p>

<p class="indent">On Nov. 25 the Supreme Court
suspended three lawyers charged
with unprofessional conduct: Mr.
William M. Rysdyk, of Jersey
City, for one year; Mr. Charles
Sloff, of Passaic, for one year, and
Mr. Charles K. Richmond, of Passaic,
for two years. In the first
two cases the cause was financial
misappropriation, and in the last
case an endeavor to influence a
juryman.</p>

the Orphans&#146; Court appealed from
the decree of said Court to the
Court of Errors and Appeals. Was
this proper?</p>

<p class="indent">2. A held in trust for F certain
lands and also certain bonds. He
died intestate, leaving two sons B
and C, B being the elder. C was

did the title to the land and to
whom do the bonds descend?</p>

<p class="indent">3. W being under indictment by
a Federal Grand Jury, applied to
the Court for compulsory process
for the purpose of obtaining witnesses
in his behalf. His application
was denied. Was the Court
right?</p>

<p class="indent">4. A railroad company made a
mortgage upon its lands, chattels
and franchises. It was duly recorded
as a real estate mortgage but
it was not recorded as a chattel
mortgage. Was it valid as to the
chattels against creditors of the
company?</p>

<p class="indent">5. S went to work for B and took
two flags with him. He allowed B
to use one of them and helped put
it on B&#146;s building. Subsequently a
hail storm destroyed it. He then
sued B for the value of the flag.
Should he recover?</p>

<p class="indent">6. G agreed to sell and deliver
to J certain goods on or before the
15th of July. Instead of delivering
the whole of the goods he attempted
to deliver the same in instalments,
the last instalment to be delivered
on July 15. J refused to accept the
goods. Was he bound to do so?</p>

<p class="indent">7. Where there is a plain repugnancy
between the provisions of an
original contract, and those of a
supplemental one between the same
parties relating to the same subject
matter, which one controls?</p>

<p class="indent">8. S, being indebted to a number
of persons, advertised and sold at

without the authority of the other
member, confessed a judgment to
Y, a creditor of the firm. Was the
judgment binding upon the firm?</p>

<p class="indent">10. An agent acting within the
scope of his authority, did certain

<p class="indent">11. What are the requirements to
make an instrument negotiable?</p>

<p class="indent">12. John Smith made a will,
wherein he gave his son, Thomas,
a legacy of $5,000, adding that the
legacy should be void if Thomas
married any one of the daughters
of Robert Jones. Thomas having
married one of Jones&#146; daughters,
demanded the legacy, claiming that
the condition was void. Was his
claim good?</p>

at law of B, filed a bill in Chancery
to set aside the will on the ground
of fraud. D moves to strike out.
What should the Court do?</p>

<p class="indent">17. B sued A for slander. A
pleaded that he was intoxicated at
the time he uttered the slander. B
moved to strike out this defence.
What should the Court do?</p>

<p class="indent">18. A sued the City of N for
damages. He showed that he had
been run over by an ash-cart owned
and operated by the City by reason
of the driver&#146;s negligence and that
the driver was drunk at the time
and was drunk to the knowledge of
the City&#146;s foreman when the latter
sent him out with the cart. The
City moved to nonsuit. Should the
motion be granted?</p>

<p class="indent">19. A sued B for damages by
reason of injuries caused by the
joint negligence of B and C. He
recovered a judgment which B
paid. B then sued C for contribution.
Could he recover?</p>

<p class="indent">20. A was indicted for murder
of B. On the trial it was shown
that A killed B while B was trying
to rob him on the highway. The
prosecutor contended that A could
not be acquitted unless it appeared
that he could not have rendered the
attempt to rob abortive by any
means less radical. The Court
overruled this contention. Was the
ruling correct?</p>

Chancery, defendant set up the
statute of limitations, but this defense
did not appear in the answer.
Could the defendant avail himself
of it?</p>

<p class="indent">29. A bill in equity failed to state
any equitable cause of action. What
would you advise your client to
do?</p>

<p class="indent">30. A and B came into the office
of C, an attorney, to have him draw
a deed from A conveying property
to B. Before the deed was drawn,

she entitled to the same?</p>

<p class="indent">3. The Board of Aldermen of the
City of J passed an ordinance that
no one should conduct a grocery
store in the city unless he was a
citizen of the State of New Jersey.
A, a citizen of New York, having
been found guilty of violating this
ordinance, certioraried his conviction
to the Supreme Court. What
should the Court do?</p>

<p class="indent">4. A mortgagee in a chattel mortgage
held the same for ten days
after the delivery of the mortgage

and T sued S because of his failure
to return the automobile. Was he
liable?</p>

<p class="indent">6. A purchased an automobile
from an infant and sold it to B in
good faith for value, neither A nor
B having notice of the infancy of
A&#146;s vendor. Was it a valid sale?</p>

<p class="indent">7. R was indebted to S and the
latter started a suit to recover the
amount due. Thereupon G agreed
with S that if he would discontinue

before again suing, he would be responsible
for the debt. This was
done. At the end of the three
months was G liable?</p>

<p class="indent">10. The partnership accounts between
D and M were unsettled, although
they had dissolved partnership.
D alone could settle them,
but refused to do so. What kind of
action could M institute against D?</p>

<p class="indent">11. Smith purchased a horse
from Jones, giving him in payment
a check on a bank which he
(Smith) had had certified. Smith
having learned that Jones had no
title to the horse stopped payment
on the check. Jones sued the bank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
which answered, setting up want of
consideration for the check. Could
it do so?</p>

<p class="indent">12. A died January 1, 1915, leaving
a last will wherein he bequeathed
$5,000 to his son, John,
then aged 18, and $5,000 to the A
hospital, and the residue of his

1921, leaving a husband, Peter
Jones, by whom she had never had
children, and three children by a
prior marriage. She left a will devising

but made no disposition of
her personal estate. To whom did
her real and personal estate go on
her death?</p>

<p class="indent">14. B, a creditor of the insolvent
firm of J. &amp; S., agreed to sell and
assign his claim to D for the sum

his title, B refusing to bring an
action?</p>

<p class="indent">16. Brown, as executor of Smith,
filed his final account in the Orphans&#146;
Court of Salem County, and
gave notice of settlement. Grey,
one of the residuary legatees, desired
to have the accounting in
Chancery. Was this possible? If
so, how should he proceed and what
must he show?</p>

<p class="indent">17. In the trial of an action for
libel wherein plaintiff claimed compensatory
damages only, defendant
offered in mitigation of damages
evidence that the publication was
made in good faith and with honest
belief in its truth. The Court excluded
the offer, and this ruling was
attacked on appeal. Was it correct?</p>

<p class="indent">18. Plaintiff, aged nine, who was
struck and injured by an automobile
while crossing a street, brought
suit. The defense was contributory
negligence. The Court charged
that a child of that age could be
charged with contributory negligence,
but that in considering that
question it was for the jury to consider
whether the plaintiff had exercised
the caution which would
reasonably be expected from one of
his years. Was this charge correct?</p>

<p class="indent">19. A, an owner of a dwelling
house, brought an action against B,
who had a tannery in the next
block, alleging and showing on trial
that noxious fumes from B&#146;s tannery
had made plaintiff&#146;s house
untenantable. B moved to nonsuit
on the ground that these fumes injured
a large number of houses,
were a public nuisance and the only
remedy was by indictment. The
court refused to nonsuit. Was this
ruling correct?</p>

<p class="indent">20. In what case and under what
circumstances can a writ of error
issue directly from the Court of
Errors and Appeals to the Court
of Oyer and Terminer?</p>

acquired by the wife during
coverture? What is the rule in New

died. There was no provision
in the by-laws for the election of
his successor. How can the place
be filled?</p>

<p class="indent">23. On a bill for the construction
of a will, evidence was offered of
declarations made by the testator
at the time of making the will as
to his meaning and intention.
Should this evidence be received?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span>
24. In a suit involving an account,
it appears that the defendant
had admitted that a certain sum
was due. The defendant, however,
demanded the production of the
plaintiff&#146;s books and on refusal
moved for a nonsuit. Should the
motion be granted?</p>

<p class="indent">25. How is an issue of fact created
in a lawsuit?</p>

<p class="indent">26. Where may the venue be
laid in a transitory action?</p>

<p class="indent">27. How should service of summons
and complaint be made in a
case where an affidavit of merits is
desired?</p>

<p class="indent">28. X in a bill against Y in his
prayer asked for answer without
oath. Y answered under oath.
How should the answer be construed?</p>

prayed for fails?</p>

<p class="indent">30. A, clerk in a law firm, not
yet admitted to the Bar, receiving
a regular salary, had his friends
retain his employers. Should the
firm divide its fees with the clerk?</p>

brief illness of bronchial pneumonia,
Supreme Court Justice Bennet

of Aaron Van Syckel, and Mary
Van Syckel, of Bethlehem, Hunterdon
county, and was born there
April 17, 1830. His father and his
grandfather were country merchants,
whose ancestors came with
the old Dutch settlers to that part
of New Jersey. His father was

and was able to give his four sons
an excellent education. When Bennet
was nine years old he was sent
to a boarding school at Easton. At
the age of thirteen he completed
his preparatory studies and entered
Princeton in the Sophomore class.
Three years later he was graduated
with high honors and for one year
was resident graduate Assistant
Professor to Joseph Henry, who
occupied the chair of Natural Philosophy.</p>

<p class="indent">Bennet next took up the study
of law in the office of Alexander
Wurts of Flemington, and was prepared
to take his law examination
some time before he was of age,
but as he could not be admitted
to the Bar while under twenty-one
was forced to wait. On the twenty-first
anniversary of his birthday,
at the April Term of the Supreme
Court, 1851, he was admitted to the
Bar, and became counselor at the
June Term, 1854. He at once
opened office in Flemington, and
practiced there with unusual success
until February, 1858, when
Governor Randolph appointed him
Justice of the Supreme Court. At
that time he was the youngest member
of the Court. His Circuits
were in the counties of Salem,
Cumberland, Atlantic and Cape
May. When the number of Supreme
Court Justices was increased
from seven to nine and the districts
were readjusted, Justice Van Syckel
was assigned to Union and
Ocean counties, where he presided
twenty-nine years. He was five
times reappointed. Only a few
months after his last appointment
in 1904 he resigned because of ill
health and increasing age.</p>

<p class="indent">After his retirement Justice Van
Syckel was made the guest of the
New Jersey Bench and Bar, at
Trenton, upon which occasion a
portrait of him painted in oil was
presented to the State, to be hung
on the wall of the Supreme Court
room at the Capitol. A few months
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
later another portrait was hung in
the new court house in Union
County, in honor of the Justice who
had presided there for so many
years.</p>

<p class="indent">During his term of service Justice
Van Syckel delivered some of
the most important opinions of the
Supreme Court and of the Court of
Errors and Appeals. In the prosecution
of the Linden and Elizabeth
race track gamblers in 1893 he
proved a terror to poolsellers, bookmakers
and evildoers. It was Justice
Van Syckel who wrote the
opinion of the Supreme Court when
an effort was made to challenge the
majority cast in favor of the anti-gambling
amendment to the State
Constitution, and his opinion upholding
the adoption of the amendments
was sustained by the Court
of Errors and Appeals.</p>

<p class="indent">At the time of his death a membership
in the directorate of the
Prudential Life Insurance Company
was the former Justice&#146;s sole
business affiliation. His activity in
connection with this post caused his
associates to marvel. He attended
all the meetings and was as alert
as the youngest of his colleagues.
At the Princeton alumni reunion in
June, 1920, he led the Parade
around the baseball field and got a
big ovation from the throng in attendance.
In his automobile he
arose repeatedly and raised his hat
in acknowledgment of the applause.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1911, Woodrow Wilson, when
Governor, appointed him and former
State Attorney General Edmund
Wilson, of Red Bank, as a
commission to study the proposed
abandonment of the Morris Canal.
The report was adverse to the State
taking over the canal. The Justice
aided in the drafting of the &#147;Seven
Sisters&#148; Acts, passed during the
Wilson administration, which were
designed to curb the activities of
the trusts in New Jersey.</p>

<p class="indent">Justice Van Syckel was a lover
of outdoor sports. In his younger
days he played town ball and football
and later was a great admirer
of baseball. He rode horseback,
played golf and was a fine wing
shot. In politics he was a Democrat,
but politics had no place with
him while he sat on the Bench.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Van Syckel married Miss
Mary Elizabeth Sloane, daughter
of Mr. and Mrs. William Hand
Sloane. He is survived by two
sons, Charles S. and William S.,
and a daughter, Bessie.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Judge William R. Francis</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">Former New Jersey State Senator
and former Supreme Court
Judge of Dakota, William R. Francis,
died in the City Hospital in
Newark, this State, on Dec. 15th
last, aged 82 years. His death was
the result of a fall in the bedroom
of his home, 324 S. Orange Ave.,
Newark.</p>

<p class="indent">Judge Francis was born in Connecticut.
He was a graduate from
Oberlin College and then came to
Newark, where he became a member
of the law firm of Titsworth,
Francis &amp; Marsh. He served as
city counsel of Newark from 1871
to 1875 and in the State Senate
from 1879 to 1881. In 1882 Mr.
Francis went to Dakota. At that
time the two Dakotas were united
in a territory of the United States.
After completing his term as Supreme
Court Judge there he became
attorney for the Northern Pacific
Railroad. About twenty years ago
he returned to Newark. Mr. Francis
was a Master in Chancery and
had offices with Scharringhausen &amp;
Hartpence, 800 Broad street. Mr.
Francis is survived by a widow,
who was Miss Annie Yeomans of
Newark. He is also survived by a
niece, Mrs. C. L. Bryant of Danbury,
Conn., and a cousin, Miss
Mary Francis, of Newark.</p>
